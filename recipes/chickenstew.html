    <h1>Chicken Stews</h1>

    <img style="width: 300px;" src="../images/Chicken-Stew.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Thick hearty chicken stew that's absolutely packed full of  flavor!</p>

    <h2>Use Chicken Thighs</h2>
        <p>Look, I know some people really don’t like dark meat, but that those tender chicken thighs really take this dish to the next level. I strongly advise against using chicken breast, but if you must, opt for a bone-in chicken breast for a little more flavor, then just shred and remove the bones after the stew simmers.</p>

    <h2>Broth</h2>
        <p>You really want to use a good quality, flavorful broth for this chicken stew. I used Better Than Bouillon because it’s my favorite and it tends to be very flavorful. I also used a combination of two types of broth, chicken and vegetable, which I really think adds to the complexity of the flavor and helps deepen the color of the broth. </p>
