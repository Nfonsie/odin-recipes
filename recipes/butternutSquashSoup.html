    <h1>Butternut Squash Soup</h1>
        <img style="width: 300px;" src="../images/butternut-squash-soup.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <h3>Served piping hot with a hunk of crusty bread, this creamy, nourishing butternut squash soup recipe is fall comfort food at its best.</h3>

                <p>In the past, my go-to butternut squash soup recipe has included coconut milk and curry spices, but this fall, I found myself craving one that was a bit more traditional. When I say traditional, I don’t mean that I use chicken stock, heavy cream, or butter in this recipe. It’s a delicious, all-veggie healthy butternut squash soup with ginger, sage, and rosemary. This is basically fall in a bowl.</p>

                <p>We’ve been loving this soup lately – it’s creamy and nourishing, perfect for satisfying cozy fall cravings. With only 10 ingredients, it’s easy to make, so cook a big batch today, and enjoy the soup all week long! Happy fall.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Butternut squash – This soup packs in 3 pounds of squash, so look for a medium-large one at the store or farmers market. If you don’t have a scale at home, I recommend weighing the squash when you buy it!</li>
                    <li>Yellow onion and garlic – These veggies add delicious depth of flavor.</li>
                    <li>Fresh sage and rosemary – I don’t reach for rosemary as often as some other fresh herbs, but I absolutely love it here. Along with the sage, it makes this soup cozy and complex.</li>
                    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil – 2 tablespoons add the perfect amount of richness.</li>
                    <li>Vegetable broth – Because the blended squash becomes creamy on its own, there’s no need for dairy, coconut milk, or nuts here! With veggie broth as its base, this is a vegan butternut squash soup recipe.</li>
                    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper – Add them with the onion at the start of the cooking process, but make sure to taste and adjust at the end as well. That way, you’ll make a soup you really love!</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>First, chop the veggies!</li>
                    <li>Sauté the onion until it becomes translucent, add the squash, and cook until it begins to soften.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the herbs, garlic.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the broth and simmer until the squash becomes tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When the squash is soft, transfer the soup to a blender. Blend until the soup is vibrant orange and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Finally, pour it into bowls, garnish with chopped parsley and pepitas, and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
